# CIF dictionary for magnetic studies
This repository tracks the development of a CIF dictionary for describing magnetic structures.  As the version here may contain
draft and not yet approved items, it should not be relied upon. The [official IUCr version](https://www.iucr.org/resources/cif/dictionaries/cif_mag) is the best reference.
